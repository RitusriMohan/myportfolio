## About Me

Hello! I’m Ritusri Mohan, a passionate data analyst and digital strategist dedicated to transforming data into actionable insights. My journey began with a fascination for numbers and patterns, which led me to pursue advanced studies in Applied Business Analytics and Data Science. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working on diverse projects—ranging from predictive modeling and market research to creative digital marketing campaigns—that have helped businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions.

What excites me most about my work is the intersection of analytical rigor and creative problem-solving. I thrive on uncovering trends, telling stories through data, and building solutions that drive real impact. My core values are curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning, and I bring these to every project I take on.

Outside of work, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, mentoring aspiring analysts, or capturing moments through photography. I believe that a well-rounded life fuels innovative thinking and meaningful connections.

Feel free to browse my portfolio to see examples of my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or just say hello!
